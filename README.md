# loading_circle
#throbber
#loading_icon
On websites, when loading or uploading or opening a web page or sending a message, 
You definitely saw the loading circle. In this project, 
I have designed the loading circle with the help of #CSS #html and also the grid system framework that I designed with pure #CSS.
